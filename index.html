        <h2>About Fei</h2>
        <p>
            Fei is the kind of person who sends hearts and worry in the same breath. Someone whose kindness lingers like brushstrokes on a canvas. She notices the little things. Reacts with her whole heart. Loves with gentleness but never fragility.
        </p>
        <p>
            A dreamer with deep roots, Fei sees beauty where others rush past. Her art carries that same soul—soft but sure, whimsical yet raw. She's not loud, but you feel her presence like a quiet melody that stays with you long after it ends.
        </p>
        <p>
            She’s the person who remembers, who checks in when it’s late, who offers warmth without demand. Fei’s world isn’t made to impress, it’s made to feel. And when she paints, she doesn’t just show you what she sees… she lets you feel what she feels.
        </p>
        <p>
            This gallery is more than a showcase. It’s a doorway into Fei’s heart. And you’re welcome here.
